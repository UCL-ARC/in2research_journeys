### What is my project about?

I am building a machine learning model that predicts errors, and using these to optimise quantum circuits.

### Why use Quantum Computers, and what problems exist?

* Quantum computers promise revolutionary speedups due to quantum mechanical effects, however its reliability is limited by noisy hardware. My project aims to use AI to increase efficiency and error-awareness in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, prior to Quantum Error Correction (QEC).

### Overall Goal

* Develop an AI-enhanced quantum circuit optimiser.
* Predict the effects of quantum noise (qubit decoherence, quantum gate and measurement errors)
* Recommend optimisations to improve the efficiency of quantum circuits.

### Tasks completed this week

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| Identified Machine Learning Methods for Quantum Circuit Optimisation (including Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks, amongst other methods)  | ✔        |
| Practiced making Quantum Circuits using IBM's Qiskit Software| ✔        |


### Next week’s plan

* Implement Quantum Algorithms and Baseline Simulations: Run ideal, noiseless simulations to establish a performance baseline of Grover's algorithm. Introduce basic quantum noise and compare performance of ideal and noisy simulations.
