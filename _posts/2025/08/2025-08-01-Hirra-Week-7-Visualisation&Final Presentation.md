This week  I made plots 📊 to convey the results more clearly, including detailed metric comparison plots between the deep learning and machine learning models for example **balanced accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**. These were created as both bar plots 📏 for easy comparison and line graphs 📈 to show performance across models.  

I also started preparing my presentation 🗣️ for next week’s collaboration hour, where I will present my project, methodology and key findings to an audience. Alongside this, I began planning the format of my final research output 📄, considering whether a **poster** and a **research paper** would be the most effective combination to communicate the work and results.

**Challenges** 🤔❓  
* A large number of experimental pipelines to review, need to carefully select the best performing ones and the most insightful visualisations to include in the final presentation and paper 🛠️  
* Balancing clarity with technical depth when presenting results to a mixed audience 🎯  

**Next steps** ➡️ 
* Finalise code, make it more modular and upload to GitHub 💻   
* Present at collaboration hour 🎤 
* Begin drafting the final research output ✍️
