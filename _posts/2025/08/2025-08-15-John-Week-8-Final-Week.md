### Highlights
- After spending a few weeks on my presentation, I finally presented in front of the department at the Tuesday Social Hour. I did my best to keep it under 15 minutes, and even had time for some questions. I received some promising feedback afterwards, so it was a pleasant experience overall.
- The poster that I'll be presenting at the In2Research Celebration event is (nearly) complete. I'm glad to have some much help and advice from my supervisors to help me design my poster. Looking forward to presenting my work to an even greater audience.

As this will be my last blog post, I'd like to thank In2Research, ARC, and my supervisors for supporting me for the past 8 weeks as I learn and contribute to this project.
