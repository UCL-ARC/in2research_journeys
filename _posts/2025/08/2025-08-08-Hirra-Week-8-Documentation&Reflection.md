This week I completed my presentation slides 📑 and received valuable feedback from my supervisor, which helped refine the content and style. I then presented at the ARC collaboration hour 🎤 , a great opportunity to improve my presentation skills and communicate my project to a wider audience.  

I also created a research poster 🖼️ to visualise and convey my results, and have now started writing my research paper 📝 to submit to In2Research before the deadline.

**In2Research Reflection**  💭  
I had a really positive experience with ARC, gaining a range of new skills and improving my confidence. I overcame several challenges, such as:  
- Finding suitable datasets to build a reliable model 🔍  
- Trialling and testing multiple pipelines to achieve strong results, a process that can be very time consuming ⏳  
- Expanding my knowledge beyond familiar machine learning models to learn more about transformer architectures 🤖  
- Strengthening and structuring my python coding skills through staged development 💻  

Overall, I’ve gained both technical expertise and transferable skills, while developing a greater appreciation for the research process.

- Continue writing the research paper ✍️  
- Finalise all outputs for submission 📄  
- Share code on GitHub 💻
